PhD student working with [Professor Peter Seiler](https://seiler.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on robust control, optimization, and online (real-time) learning for high-precision control applications. Selected papers can be found at the bottom of this page and a complete list can be found in the [publications](/publications/) page.

(FYI, my website is a work in progress!)
