PhD student working with [Professor Peter Seiler](https://seiler.engin.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. My research focuses on robust control, optimization, and online (real-time) learning for high-precision control applications.

Selected papers can be found at the bottom of this page and a complete list can be found in the [publications](/publications/) page.

Before Michigan, I did my undergraduate studies at Iowa State University where I received my BS in Electrical Engineering. [#rollclones](https://www.iastate.edu/) 🌪️

(FYI, my website is a work in progress!)
