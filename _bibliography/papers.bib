  abstract = {Disturbance rejection in high-precision control applications can be significantly improved upon via online convex optimization (OCO). This includes classical techniques such as recursive least squares (RLS) and more recent, regret-based formulations. However, these methods can cause instabilities in the presence of model uncertainty. This paper introduces a safety filter for systems with OCO in the form of adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filtering to ensure robust disturbance rejection. The safety filter enforces a robust stability constraint on the FIR coefficients while minimally altering the OCO command in the ∞-norm cost. Additionally, we show that the induced ℓ∞-norm allows for easy online implementation of the safety filter by directly limiting the OCO command. The constraint can be tuned to trade off robustness and performance. We provide a simple example to demonstrate the safety filter.},

  abstract={Online convex optimization (OCO) is a powerful tool for learning sequential data, making it ideal for high precision control applications where the disturbances are arbitrary and unknown in advance. However, the ability of OCObased controllers to accurately learn the disturbance while maintaining closed-loop stability relies on having an accurate model of the plant. This paper studies the performance of OCObased controllers for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to disturbance and model uncertainty. The model uncertainty can cause the closed-loop to become unstable. We provide a sufficient condition for robust stability based on the small gain theorem. This condition is easily incorporated as an on-line constraint in the OCO controller. Finally, we verify via numerical simulations that imposing the robust stability condition on the OCO controller ensures closed-loop stability.},

  abstract={Short non-coding RNAs, which are known as microRNAs (miRNAs), play a key role in fundamental cellular processes by post-transcription regulations. This paper reports a paper-based miRNA exponential amplification and detection system for rapid analysis of miRNAs. The paper-based sensor system consists of a silicone frame, glass microfiber pads for the storage of reaction reagents, a polyethersulfone flow channel for sample delivery, and two transparent and adhesive films to seal the glass microfiber pads inside reaction chambers. The results showed that the paper-based miRNA sensor can detect miRNA-223 with a concentration as low as 10 pM within one hour.},
